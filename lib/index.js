        HauteCouture brief explanation:
        hapi pal's directory and file structure is governed by a tool called
        haute-couture, which you can see is used in your project at lib/index.js.
        When you place a file in the routes/ directory, as hpal did for us here,
        it will automatically be added to your application plugin because
        haute-couture will make the call to server.route() for you!
        The same can be said for other plugin functionalityâ€”you'll find that
        models go in models/, authentication strategies go in auth/strategies/,
        etc.
